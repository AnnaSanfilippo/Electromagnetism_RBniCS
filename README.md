# Electromagnetism RBniCS - reduced order modelling in FEniCS

The material in this repository is about an electromagnetic problem and its implementation with a reduced basis method.

In this repository all the codes are implemented in RBniCS enviroment.
The RBniCS Project contains an implementation in FEniCS of several reduced order modelling techniques for parametrized problems.
RBniCS is currently developed and maintained at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart by Dr. Francesco Ballarin in collaboration with Prof. Gianluigi Rozza's group at SISSA mathLab. The financial support of the AROMA-CFD ERC CoG project is gratefully acknowledged.
Like all core FEniCS components, RBniCS is freely available under the GNU LGPL, version 3.
