# Reduced Basis Methods for Electromagnetic Problems

The material in this repository is about an electromagnetic problem and its implementation with FEniCS and RBniCS. Moreover, it is also included a 3D extension of the thermal toy problem, present in "Reduced Basis Methods for Partial Differential Equations: An Introduction" by Alfio Quarteroni, Andrea Manzoni and Federico Negri.

In this repository all the codes are implemented with Python in FEniCS and RBniCS enviroment.
